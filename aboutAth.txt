Authentication Patterns

Statefull
    --which maintains state or data on server side

    Working Architecture in Nodejs
        Client -- Request for Resource -- Server
        Server -- Respond With Session uid(Unique Id) -- Client

        Now, the Server has the uid state stored
        So,When client request for the Resource correspoonding to the uid

        Client / uid : 367 / -- Request for Resource -- Server
        Server checks who is user (uid) 367 , if the Client is authorized then
        Server -- Respond to  -- Client

    How to Transfer uid?
        It can be transfer as:

             | <--------------- Cookies ---------------> |
      Client | <--------------- Response --------------> | Server
             | <--------------- Headers ---------------> |

        In SSR using EJS , where we directly communicate to server we can use Cookies
        Usually in REST API , Headers are most Usually used

    Express Flow

    Client ---> Auth MiddleWare --> EndPoint Route
                | --> checks for cookie value or uid, if valid calls next() 
                      else rejects the request
                    
    

Stateless
    --which has no state
